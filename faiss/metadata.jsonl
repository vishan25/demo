Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify. Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance. I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent.

There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7. Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment. We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too. Best regards, Palaash V. Upadhyay"}

Module: Data Analysis Q11: Outlier Detection You are analyzing a dataset of employee salaries. Which visualization is best for quickly identifying outliers? A. Line chart B. Box plot C. Histogram D. Pie chart Answer: B — A box plot clearly shows the spread of data and highlights outliers as individual points beyond the whiskers. Module: Large Language Models Q12: Prompt Engineering Strategy To get consistent, structured responses from a language model when extracting key information, which approach is most effective? A. Ask the model to “summarize” the text B. Use open-ended questions C. Use system messages and JSON schema formatting D. Provide only one-word inputs Answer: C — System messages and structured output formats like JSON schemas guide the model to generate reliable and consistent structured responses. Module: Geospatial and Network Analysis Q13: Network Centrality In a social network graph of coworkers, which metric best identifies the person who connects the most groups together? A. Degree centrality B. Closeness centrality C. Betweenness centrality D. Eigenvector centrality Answer: C — Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other nodes, highlighting connectors or “bridges” in the network. Module: Data Visualization Q14: Choosing the Right Chart You want to show how the composition of a marketing budget changes across three years. Which visualization is most appropriate? A. Pie charts for each year B. Scatter plots C. Stacked bar chart D. Line chart Answer: C — A stacked bar chart shows parts of a whole across different categories and time periods, making it easier to compare budget composition over years."}

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards"}

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution. 1. Graded Assignments (GA) GA6 Doubts Unresolved: While doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link) GA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. 2. Project Updates Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved? (thread link) 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. I appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response. Best regards, Lakshay"}

However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments. The course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations. With GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS. GA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon. lakshaygarg654: Project 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful. Project 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines."}

Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway. lakshaygarg654: 3. ROE Score Update While ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected. You got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed. Kind regards"}

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards"}

I felt it was necessary to get checked out by a doctor and unfortunately had to miss ROE as a result. I was wondering if there might be any possibility of taking the ROE at a later time? Please let me know if there’s anything I can do or if any arrangements can be made."}

The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience. However, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations. Key Challenges Faced Lack of Prerequisites This course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage. Project Complexity & Deadline Pressure The difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully. Course Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback Many students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience. Remote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs) While we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated. We completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course. We truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed. Thank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives."}

Additionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring: Grading Concerns Final Course Score: T = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F (The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.) From the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students: What’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?. Given this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores. Furthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1. Course Structuring & Scheduling Issues Many students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines. The last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments. The structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time. Request for Improvement To ensure a smoother learning experience, I request: Early guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2, well in advance of the deadline. More structured and accessible support, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals. Better management of exam difficulty levels, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough. I hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response."}

This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response. Let me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP. TDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words: This course is quite hard Here’s students’ feedback: It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # # Now it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # # Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # # LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # # The ROE is hard. # Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now. TDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help Again to quote Anand: We encourage learning by sharing You CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). Why should you copy? Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel. You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well. To learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize. To learn better, teach what you’ve learnt. Now will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself). Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us."}

Once again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble. Whether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here. Then the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them. @22f2001640 Management of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity."}

I’m a standalone degree potential student and while I have learned a lot from the modules and do not condone dumbing it down, but at least after all this hard work I should be able to pass the course. While grades don’t matter in front of learning things but when passing the course itself is on the line then the learnings are overshadowed by the lack of marks. I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me. I understand that the grading can’t be changed. All I hope and request that project 2 and end term turn out to be more approachable than project 1 and ROE so that after all this hard work, students like me at least get the privilege to pass."}

Tools in Data Science @ankit.jain – I’m the culprit behind this RoE structure. Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process. What does this RoE evaluate? Implicit learning. Implicit learning is “How much can they answer if woken up from sleep?” Explicit learning is “How much can they answer given time and Internet?” Some may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They’ll answer those in a few seconds. Some, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That’s explicit learning. But it takes time…"}

But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later. ROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma. Solving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities. The truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time. The problem is the lack of time. So if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand. Additionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next. Thats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE. The real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before. But we will help you be as ready as possible for it. Kind regards"}

As the GATE exam has now been completed, we can now practice the questions we either left or could not do at that time Revision will help us ace the ROE, project and end term Overall this will increase the value of the already most practical and rewarding course of IIT BS i.e TDS.

Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards"}

A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards"}

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds. Here was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed. In a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.” The mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice. Victor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind. From within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations. Miranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \""}

Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] image250×534 3.92 KB [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place.

Here are the highlights of the discussion: We have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday. All the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago) Project 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago) We had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it. All of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students: Project 1 deadline will NOT be changed. Please make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements. Kind regards TDS Team"}

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated. Week 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week. Project help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py Inside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile which then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder. So the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully): You create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000 You create a docker image that runs this application server. You run the docker image using podman as described in the project page. For mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files: evaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts. Run evalute.py using uv. If your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task. Hope that gives clarity. Kind regards"}

Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding. Kind regards"}

I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects. Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical? That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently."}

This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies. Portability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering. Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name) • Good for quick experimentation and testing. • Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time. Using requirements.txt • Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. • Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup. Specifying Versions in requirements.txt • If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes. • If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues. Handling Version Conflicts • If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall. • Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider: • Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes). • Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment. Best Practices Summary Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda). Use a requirements.txt file for reproducibility. Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed. Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages. Kind regards"}

Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine. For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement 24f2006531: Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? Coming to your second question, The first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone’s project it’s better to use requirements.txt. 24f2006531: My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation The creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed. Never try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that, pip3 freeze > requirements.txt . This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you"}

PS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module.

Emails with `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` get a **$1 per calendar month** allowance. (Don’t exceed that.) Read the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short: 1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...` 2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login) 3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano` For example, let’s use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings: ``` curl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\", \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }] }' curl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\ -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Or using [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/): ``` llm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1 llm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001 export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1 llm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-smallCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` **For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: \"flex\"` to your JSON request. [AI Proxy - Jan 2025](#/large-language-models?id=ai-proxy-jan-2025) ------------------------------------------------------------------- For the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. Your usage is limited to **$1 per calendar month** for this course. Don’t exceed that. **Use [AI Proxy](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)** instead of OpenAI. Specifically: 1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...` 2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you.

Data Sourcing_0", "text": "[Data Sourcing](#/data-sourcing?id=data-sourcing) ================================================= Before you do any kind of data science, you obviously have to get the data to be able to analyze it, visualize it, narrate it, and deploy it. And what we are going to cover in this module is how you get the data. There are three ways you can get the data. 1. The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it’s a public data source. But that’s the first way—you download the data. 2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together. 3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It’s not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It’s available on a PDF file. It’s available in a Word document. It’s available on an Excel file. It’s kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there. In this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources. [!

Users can log in with their existing Google accounts. * It’s secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication. Here’s how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user. 1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console – Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**. 2. Choose **Web application**, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`). 3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into a `.env` file: ``` GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secretCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` 4. Create your FastAPI `app.py`: ``` # /// script # dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"] # /// import os from dotenv import load_dotenv from fastapi import FastAPI, Request from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse from starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware from authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth load_dotenv() app = FastAPI() app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\") oauth = OAuth() oauth.register( name=\"google\", client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"), client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"), server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\", client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"}, ) @app.get(\"/\") async def application(request: Request): user = request.session.get(\"user\") # 3.

(3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY) Here’s how it works: * It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters * … using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4) * There’s a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs * Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters) Common Python operations with Base64: ``` import base64 # Basic encoding/decoding text = \"Hello, World!\" # Convert text to base64 encoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Convert base64 back to text decoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World! # Convert to URL-safe base64 url_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ== # Working with binary files (e.g., images) with open('image.png', 'rb') as f: binary_data = f.read() image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode() # Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS) data_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Data URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size. For example, here’s an SVG image embedded as a data URI: ``` Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Base64 is used in many places: * JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads * Email: MIME attachments encoding * Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers * JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication * SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format * SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO * Git: Encoding binary files in patches Tools for working with Base64: * [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding * [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs [Previous LLM Text Extraction](#/llm-text-extraction) [Next Vision Models](#/vision-models)"}

For example: * **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing * **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content * **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption * **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms * **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization * **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats * **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers This tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow – all using the command line. ### [defuddle-cli](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=defuddle-cli) [defuddle-cli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It’s a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important. ``` find . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` * `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories * `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found * `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting * `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown * `-o {}.md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension ### [Pandoc](#/convert-html-to-markdown?id=pandoc) [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters. Pandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors. [!

These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar. This is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems: 1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query. 2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories. 3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters. 4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text. You can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality. | Feature | Local Models | API | | --- | --- | --- | | **Privacy** | High | Dependent on provider | | **Cost** | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go | | **Scale** | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand | | **Quality** | Varies by model | Typically high | The [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at: 1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality. 2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run. 3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store. 4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a *single* input. 5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs. ### [Local Embeddings](#/embeddings?id=local-embeddings) [!

[Gemini transcription](#/extracting-audio-and-transcripts?id=gemini-transcription) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways: 1. They have a *huge* input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example. 2. They can handle audio input. This allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. LLMs are not good at transcribing audio *faithfully*. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples: 1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step. 2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions. 3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate. 4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation. Here’s how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files. 1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio. 2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key. 3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe. 4. Run this code: ``` curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\ -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"$(cat << EOF { \"contents\": [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"parts\": [ { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\", \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\" } }, {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"} ] } ] } EOF )\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` [Previous Transforming Images](#/transforming-images) [Next 6.

This is perfect for building chatbots and AI assistants that need to interact with your backend systems. OpenAI supports [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) – a way for LLMs to suggest what functions to call and how. [! [OpenAI Function Calling - Full Beginner Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aqdWSYWC_LI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/aqdWSYWC_LI) Here’s a minimal example using Python and OpenAI’s function calling that identifies the weather in a given location. ``` # /// script # requires-python = \">=3.11\" # dependencies = [ # \"httpx\", # ] # /// import httpx import os from typing import Dict, Any def query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]: response = httpx.post( \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\", headers={ \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", }, json={ \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}], \"tools\": tools, \"tool_choice\": \"auto\", }, ) return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"] WEATHER_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_weather\", \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"} }, \"required\": [\"location\"], \"additionalProperties\": False, }, \"strict\": True, }, } if __name__ == \"__main__\": response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco? \", [WEATHER_TOOL]) print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` ### [How to define functions](#/function-calling?id=how-to-define-functions) The function definition is a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) with a few OpenAI specific properties. See the [Supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas). Here’s an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting: ``` MEETING_TOOL = { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\", \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"date\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\" }, \"time\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\" }, \"meeting_room\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\" } }, \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` ### [How to define multiple functions](#/function-calling?id=how-to-define-multiple-functions) You can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the `tools` parameter. Here’s an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses: ``` tools = [ { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\", \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } }, { \"type\": \"function\", \"function\": { \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\", \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\", \"parameters\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"employee_id\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Employee ID number\" }, \"current_year\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\" } }, \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"], \"additionalProperties\": False }, \"strict\": True } } ]Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Best Practices: 1. **Use Strict Mode** * Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls * Define all required parameters * Set `additionalProperties: False` 2. **Use tool choice** * Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools * The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate 3."}

By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. [TypeSense](https://typesense.org/) makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation. Below is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line. ### [Install and run TypeSense](#/hybrid-rag-typesense?id=install-and-run-typesense) [Install TypeSense](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html). ``` mkdir typesense-data docker run -p 8108:8108 \\ -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\ --data-dir /data \\ --api-key=secret-key \\ --enable-corsCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` * **`docker run`**: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108 + `-p 8108:8108` maps host port to container port. + `-v typesense-data:/data` mounts a Docker volume for persistence. + `--data-dir /data` points TypeSense at that volume. + `--api-key=secret-key` secures your API. + `--enable-cors` allows browser-based requests. **Expected output:** * Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as `Started Typesense API server`. * Listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8108`. ### [Embed and import documents into TypeSense](#/hybrid-rag-typesense?id=embed-and-import-documents-into-typesense) Follow the steps in the [RAG with the CLI](#/rag-cli) tutorial to create a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line. [TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense). We’ll use that capability.

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems. [! [Building LLM Agents with LangChain (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/DWUdGhRrv2c/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/DWUdGhRrv2c) ### [What Makes an Agent? ](#/llm-agents?id=what-makes-an-agent) An LLM agent consists of three core components: 1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next 2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution) 3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps Agents operate through a loop: * Observe the environment * Think about what to do * Take action using tools * Observe results * Repeat until task completion ### [Command-Line Agent Example](#/llm-agents?id=command-line-agent-example) We’ve created a minimal command-line agent called [`llm-cmd-agent.py`](llm-cmd-agent.py) that: 1. Takes a task description from the command line 2. Generates code to accomplish the task 3. Automatically extracts and executes the code 4. Passes the results back to the LLM 5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails Here’s how it works: ``` uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\" uv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` The agent will: 1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes 2. Execute the script in a subprocess 3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr) 4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation 5. Present a final answer to the user Under the hood, the agent follows this workflow: 1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script 2. Code extraction from the LLM response 3. Code execution in a subprocess 4. Result interpretation by the LLM 5. Error handling and retry logic if needed This demonstrates the core agent loop of: * Planning (generating code) * Execution (running the code) * Reflection (interpreting results) * Adaptation (fixing errors if needed) ### [Agent Architectures](#/llm-agents?id=agent-architectures) Different agent architectures exist for different use cases: 1. **ReAct** (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning steps with actions 2. **Reflexion**: Adds self-reflection to improve reasoning 3. **MRKL** (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language): Combines neural and symbolic modules 4. **Plan-and-Execute**: Creates a plan first, then executes steps ### [Real-World Applications](#/llm-agents?id=real-world-applications) LLM agents can be applied to various domains: 1. **Research assistants** that search, summarize, and synthesize information 2. **Coding assistants** that write, debug, and explain code 3. **Data analysis agents** that clean, visualize, and interpret data 4. **Customer service agents** that handle queries and perform actions 5. **Personal assistants** that manage schedules, emails, and tasks ### [Project Ideas](#/llm-agents?id=project-ideas) Here are some practical agent projects you could build: 1. **Study buddy agent**: Helps create flashcards, generates practice questions, and explains concepts 2. **Job application assistant**: Searches job listings, tailors resumes, and prepares interview responses 3. **Personal finance agent**: Categorizes expenses, suggests budgets, and identifies savings opportunities 4. **Health and fitness coach**: Creates workout plans, tracks nutrition, and provides motivation 5."}

In this tutorial, we’ll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently. For example, we’ll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object. [! [JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g) This requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don’t fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing: | Tool | Extract from JSON… | Why | | --- | --- | --- | | [jq](#/parsing-json?id=command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing | | [JMESPath](#/parsing-json?id=jmespath-queries) | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax | | [ijson](#/parsing-json?id=streaming-with-ijson) | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently | | [Pandas](#/parsing-json?id=pandas-json-columns) | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data | | [SQL JSON](#/parsing-json?id=sql-json-functions) | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data | | [DuckDB](#/parsing-json?id=duckdb-json-processing) | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory | **Examples:** * Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis. * Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium. * Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.

Out of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on: * [Course content](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01/) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025. * [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025. [Scrape the data](#/project-tds-virtual-ta?id=scrape-the-data) -------------------------------------------------------------- To make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source. [Create an API](#/project-tds-virtual-ta?id=create-an-api) ---------------------------------------------------------- Your application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let’s assume it’s at `https://app.example.com/api/`. The endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON. For example, here’s how anyone can make a request: ``` curl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\"Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` This is a [real question](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939) and uses this [screenshot](#/images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp): ! [Screenshot](/images/project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp) The response must be a JSON object like this: ``` { \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question. \", \"links\": [ { \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4\", \"text\": \"Use the model that’s mentioned in the question.\" }, { \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3\", \"text\": \"My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.\" } ] }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` [Evaluate your application](#/project-tds-virtual-ta?id=evaluate-your-application) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Here are a few [sample questions and evaluation parameters](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml). These are **indicative**. The actual evaluation could ask *any* realistic student question. To run this: 1. Edit [`project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml`](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml) to replace `providers[0].config.url` with your API URL. 2.

One of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions. The most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves: * [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/) * [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design) * [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) Here are some best practices: ### [Use prompt optimizers](#/prompt-engineering?id=use-prompt-optimizers) They rewrite your prompt to improve it.

Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture. * **BAD**: *Explain gravitation lensing. * (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.) * **GOOD**: *Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy. * (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.) > When you ask a question, don’t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs. > The clearer you are, the better the answer you’ll get. > For example, don’t just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing. > Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it’s observed and its significance in astronomy.

This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style. * **BAD**: *Explain how to tie a bow tie. * (Reason: No examples or reference points given.) * **GOOD**: *Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:* 1. *To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight…* 2. *To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through…* *Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie. * (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.) > Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don’t just say ‘build something.’ > Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.

This provides context and helps tailor the response style. * **BAD**: *Explain how to fix a software bug. * (Reason: No role or perspective given.) * **GOOD**: *You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process. * (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.) > Tell the model who they are. Maybe they’re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication. > By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style. > Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it’s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.

This helps the model understand structure and requirements. * **BAD**: *Here’s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example. * (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.) * **GOOD**: ``` Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning. Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).

This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized. * **BAD**: *Just list the items. * (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.) * **GOOD**: ``` Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this: ```json [ { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" }, { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" } ] ```Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.) Note: Always use [JSON schema](#/playground?id=attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data.

LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales. * **BAD**: *On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works? * (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.) * **GOOD**: *Is this method likely to work as intended?"}

This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results. * **BAD**: *What is the best route to take? * (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.) * **GOOD**: *First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you’ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route. * (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.) > BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking.

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast Python package and project manager that’s becoming the standard for running Python scripts. It replaces tools like pip, conda, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, and virtualenv into one, enabling: * **Python Version Management**: uv installs and manages *multiple* Python versions, allowing developers to specify and switch between versions seamlessly. * **Virtual Environment Handling**: It automates the creation and management of virtual environments, ensuring isolated and consistent development spaces for different projects. * **Dependency Management**: With support for the pyproject.toml format, uv enables precise specification of project dependencies. It maintains a universal lockfile, uv.lock, to ensure reproducible installations across different systems. * **Project Execution**: The `uv run` command allows for the execution of scripts and applications within the managed environment, streamlining development workflows. Here are some commonly used commands: ``` # Replace python with uv. This automatically installs Python and dependencies. uv run script.py # Run a Python script directly from the Internet uv run https://example.com/script.py # Run a Python script without installing uvx ruff # Use a specific Python version uv run --python 3.11 script.py # Add dependencies to your script uv add httpx --script script.py # Create a virtual environment at .venv uv venv # Install packages to your virtual environment uv pip install httpxCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Here are some useful tools you can run with `uvx` without installation: ``` uvx --from jupyterlab jupyter-lab # Jupyter notebook uvx marimo # Interactive notebook uvx llm # Chat with LLMs from the command line uvx openwebui # Chat with LLMs via the browser uvx httpie # Make HTTP requests uvx datasette # Browse SQLite databases uvx markitdown # Convert PDF to Markdown uvx yt-dlp # Download YouTube videos uvx asciinema # Record your terminal and play itCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` uv uses [inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata) for dependencies.

Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain‑specific questions without fine‑tuning. In particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example: ``` Q=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\" # Answer: fat arrow Q=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\" # Answer: node.getChildren() Q=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren’t in the AST called?\" # Answer: trivia Q=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\" # Answer: ! !Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` You can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code.

They’re perfect for small web tools that *don’t need to run all the time*. Here are some common real-life uses: * A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day) * A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo) * A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question) * A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up) * A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale) You only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they’re done, these copies disappear. It’s cheaper than running a full-time server because you’re not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time! Rather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example: * You can’t `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt` * You can’t read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs. * You can’t run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`) [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments. Here’s a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file. To deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency. ``` fastapiCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Add your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`. ``` # main.py from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"message\": \"Hello, World! \"}Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Add a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository. ``` { \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }], \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(. *)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }] }Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` On the command line, run: * `npx vercel` to deploy a test version * `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production **Environment Variables**.

From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models. But one critical subject that’s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them? These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school: * You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you’ll have to scrape them yourself. * You learn how to train models. But soon, you’ll just pick something from HuggingFace. * You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes. [! [](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) “We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics.

Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don’t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.

You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam). **Why should you copy? ** Because in real life, there’s no time to re-invent the wheel.

We’ll take the best 4 out of your graded assignments submissions. These, combined, will have a 15% weightage. * **Remote exams are open and hard** + You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets… + The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam? ](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2) * **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It’s easy. * **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context. * **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks) * **Evaluations are mostly automated**.

Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky. Learn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn’t enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language. Some programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly. Learn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world. Unicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand: * **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers + ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only + UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII + UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java + UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple Common encoding issues you’ll encounter: ``` # Reading files with explicit encoding with open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f: text = f.read() # Handling encoding errors import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') # Detecting file encoding import chardet with open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f: result = chardet.detect(f.read()) print(result['encoding'])Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` [!

Use vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON’T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.) Vector databases are an evolving space. The first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor).

([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro)) * **Headless & headed modes**: Run without UI or in a real browser for debugging. ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro)) * **Auto‑waiting & retry**: Built‑in locators reduce flakiness.

Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content: ``` # /// script # dependencies = [\"playwright\"] # /// from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright def scrape_quotes(): with sync_playwright() as p: # Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\". browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True, channel=\"chrome\") page = browser.new_page() page.goto(\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/\") quotes = page.query_selector_all(\".quote\") for q in quotes: text = q.query_selector(\".text\").inner_text() author = q.query_selector(\".author\").inner_text() print(f\"{text} — {author}\") browser.close() if __name__ == \"__main__\": scrape_quotes()Copy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` Save as `scraper.py` and run: ``` uv run scraper.pyCopy to clipboardErrorCopied ``` You’ll see each quote plus author printed—fetched only after the JS executes.
